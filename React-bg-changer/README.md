# Code Explanation
- The main functionality of the ***React-bg-changer*** is defined in the App component in src/App.js.

- The ***useState*** hook is used to manage the color state variable, which represents the background color of the container.

- Each color button has an onClick handler that calls the setColor function with the desired color when clicked.

- The background color of the container is set using inline CSS, with the value of color as the background color.
